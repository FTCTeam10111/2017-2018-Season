#Hello! Remember that it might be helpful to use git in conjunction with Github.
#To use git, start by downloading and installing it on your computer. If you are on a Mac, access git by opening terminal.
#Once you have accessed terminal, type the following without the quotes "git --version". If git was sucessfully installed, it should list the current version. If there is an error, check again the git installation process.
Once you have sucessfully installed git and are planning on using it for the first time, you need to start by configuring git to your own computer. Start by typing git config --global user.name "YourFirstand LastName" (Note that the only part you are customizing to yourself is "YourFirstand LastName", replacing with your own name. The rest should be typed exactly. Enter this command. Then type git config --global user.email youremail@email.com. This makes it so that when you record changes we know who recorded those changes and the corresponding notes.
