This is the offical code and CAD files for FTC Team 10111 Herberger Javelinas. 

# For uploading code
Make sure the code is clearly labelled as being TeleOp or Autonomous as well as its specific purpose. Code should be in the format SCRIPTNAME_TELEOPORAUTONOMOUS (for example: TankStyle_TeleOp). That way everyone can find the files that they need, even in future years.

# For uploading CAD files
Try to limit how many versions you upload by uploading the final version from each stage. As with code, please use a clear and uniform naming convention to avoid confusion. Thanks and good luck!
